Objects in motion
Motion Detector

Need a static image or baseline image 
Objects in motion are the objects ,
 that when subtracted with baseline image still remain. 

The first frame when webcam is started ,
must be the static image

Static image is greyscaled , 
and all other frames in loop are greyscaled
Difference or `Delta frame` is made 
In difference the object in motion will have ,
light behind it from the first static photo ,
all else in photo will be blackened. 

`Threshold Frame` is turning the intensity of max ,
which shows just white or black contracting objects in frame.
Below Threshold areas are black. 
A contour is made arround the objects in white , 
and if they are over 500 px then they are considred moving. 



Python captures first frame ,
converts it to greyscaled ,
blurs it ,
stores the first frame , 
calculates difference between everyframe and first frame , 
finds contours , 
and if contours is greater than a value ,
status is 1 so moving object detected ,
and status list is appended ,
but status list starts with 0 from first frame ,
and everytime there is a change from 0 to 1 , 
or 1 to 0 in status list then the date time is recorded.
